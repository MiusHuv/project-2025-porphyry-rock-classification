        This tool classifies porphyry rock samples as **Cu-rich** or **Au-rich** based on their
        elemental composition.

        **How to Use:**
        1. Navigate to the **üöÄ Run Prediction** page using the sidebar.
        2. Upload your sample data (CSV or XLSX format).
        3. Select a pre-trained classification model.
        4. View the predictions and probabilities.
        5. Optionally, if your data includes true labels, use the **üìà Performance Visualizer**.

        The models were trained on the "2025-Project-Data.xlsx" dataset, comprising
        36 major- and trace-element features.
